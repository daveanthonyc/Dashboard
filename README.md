## Reflection
- I am a self taught coder and I really want to get into the field as a software engineer in Sydney, Australia. However I face the dilemma that all devs have of needing to prove ones own learning ability and the skill.
- I've always wanted to create some form of dashboard as analytics and process management is interesting to me, so I stumbled upon an open source project management tool called Plane.so which seemed like the perfect project to clone. I could mentally map out how I would design the system from a glance and so I copied the design but tried to code it from scratch using all the skills I have gained so far.
- I haven't used Redux Tool Kit, or Material UI extensively before and so this was a good challenge to wrestle with the APIs of these technologies.
- Some of the bigger challenges was dealing with synchrony issues when dealing with consecutive RTKQueries where one query was dependant on the result of the previous query.
- This was a react project created in Vite for its quick initial install and building.
